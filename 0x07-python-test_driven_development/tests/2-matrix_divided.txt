The ``matrix_divided`` module
=============================

Using ``matrix_divided``
-------------------------

This is an example text file in reStructuredText format. First import
``matrix_divided`` from the ``2-matrix_divided`` module:
	matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

Tests:
~~~~~~

Let's start by testing division by zero:
    
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 0))
    division by zero

Next, let's test division by a float:
    
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2.5))
    [[0.4, 0.8, 1.2], [1.6, 2.0, 2.4]]

Now, let's test division by a string:
    
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 'string'))
    div must be a number

Then, let's test when each row of the matrix has different sizes:
    
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6, 7]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    Each row of the matrix must have the same size

Now, let's test when the matrix contains non-numeric values:
    
    >>> matrix = [[1, 'string', 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Next, let's test division by a positive integer:
    
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 3))
    [[0.33, 0.67, 1.0], [1.33, 1.67, 2.0]]

Then, let's test division by a negative integer:
    
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, -3))
    [[-0.33, -0.67, -1.0], [-1.33, -1.67, -2.0]]

Now, let's test division by 1:
    
    >>> matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 1))
    [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]

Next, let's test division by 5 on a matrix of zeros:
    
    >>> matrix = [[0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 5))
    [[0.0, 0.0, 0.0], [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]]

Then, let's test division by 2 on a matrix of floats:
    
    >>> matrix = [[1.5, 2.5, 3.5], [4.5, 5.5, 6.5]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, 2))
    [[0.75, 1.25, 1.75], [2.25, 2.75, 3.25]]

Finally, let's test division by -1 on a matrix of negative integers:
    
    >>> matrix = [[-1, -2, -3], [-4, -5, -6]]
    >>> print(matrix_divided(matrix, -1))
    [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]
